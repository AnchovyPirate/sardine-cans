# sardine-cans

Thank you for installing sardine-cans, a game jam abomination

sardine-cans was a project created by Eleanore Laney and Zackary Stephenson over the course of a few weeks with the intent to learn as much about solo game development as possible in as short a time as possible. You're now looking at the result. Eye bleach is down the hall, first door on the right.
